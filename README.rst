This is the repository holding the pyvideo.org bits for running the site.

The site is at `<http://pyvideo.org/>`_.

pyvideo.org is an instance of `richard <https://github.com/pyvideo/richard/>`_
which is a Django-based web application for building video index sites like
pyvideo.

We hang out on IRC in ``#richard`` on freenode.net.


Wait, but it's called pmc... Why?
=================================

Up until early March 2012, this repository held scripts and the theme
templates for Python Miro Community. When I launched pyvideo, I wanted to
keep the issues in the tracker and the scripts, so I just reused the
repository. Sorry for the confusion!
